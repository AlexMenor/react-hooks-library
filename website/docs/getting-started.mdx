# Getting Started

React Hooks Library is a collection of [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and utilities for React.
It is currently available for use in Node environments and works with any react meta framework like next, vite, astro.
Support for Deno and browsers is coming soon.

  The library is currently not v1 yet, while it's mostly stable, some aspects of
  the API may change.

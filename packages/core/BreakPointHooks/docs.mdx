# BreakPointHooks

Reactive hooks and utilities to be used with user provided breakpoints.

## Functions

Reactive hooks

- `useGreater`
- `useSmaller`
- `useBetween`

Non reactive utility function

- `isGreater`
- `isSmaller`
- `isInBetween`

## Usage

```tsx
import { BreakPointHooks, breakpointsTailwind } from '@react-hooks-library/core'

const { useGreater, useBetween, isSmaller } =
  BreakPointHooks(breakpointsTailwind)

// Non reactive check, can be used outside react components
const smaller = isSmaller('xl')

function Demo() {
  // Greater than md
  const greater = useGreater('md')

  // Betweeb md and lg
  const between = useBetween('md', 'lg')

  // smaller than 2xl
  const smaller = useSmaller('2xl')
}

return (
  <div>
    {greater && 'Greater than md'}
    {between && 'Between md & lg'}
    {smaller && 'Smaller than 2xl'}
  </div>
)
```

```tsx
import { BreakPointHooks } from '@react-hooks-library/core'

const breakpoints = {
  mobile: 425,
  tablet: 768,
  laptop: 1024,
  desktop: 1560
}

const { useGreater, useBetween } = BreakPointHooks(breakpoints)

function Demo() {
  // Greater than mobile
  const greater = useGreater('mobile')

  // Betweeb laptop and desktop
  const between = useBetween('laptop', 'desktop')

  // smaller than tablet
  const smaller = useSmaller('tablet')
}
```

## Performance Optimization

If you use the these `BreakPointHooks` a lot in your application, you run the risk of unnecessary performance loss by adding too many event listeners.
A way to optimise is to setup all of these hooks in a `context provider`  and consume them with `React.useContext()`, thus you only setup media query event listeners only once.

`React.useContext` causes re-renders in all components that consume that context, whether the consumed value is used or not,
So you can further further optimise these contexts by using either [use-context-selector](https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector) or [react-tracked](https://react-tracked.js.org/docs/quick-start/).

# useStateCompare

`useState` hook with custom compare function to avoid re-rendering when state is the same, compares with previous state.

<Callout type="info">
  create a custom `compare` function, outside of the hook to keep a stable
  reference, otherwise it will be recreated on every render
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  `compare` is only used when in `setState(value)`, `value` is not a function, in that case the default react behavior is used.
</Callout>

## Usage

```tsx
import { useStateCompare } from '@react-hooks-library/core'

type State = {
  count: number
}

const compare = (oldState: State, newState: State) =>
  oldState.count === newState.count ? oldState : newState

export function Demo() {
  const [state, setState] = useStateCompare<State>({
    initialValue: () => ({ count: 0 }),
    compare
  })

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Count - {state.count}</div>
      <button onClick={() => setState({ count: state.count + 1 })}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Type Declarations

```typescript
declare type UseStateCompare<T> = {
  initialValue: T | (() => T)
